United States of America Computing Olympiad

The United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO) is a computer programming competition for secondary school students in the United States. The USACO offers four competitions during the academic year for students at four increasingly difficult levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Participants in the USACO submit programs in one of five languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal, and Python. Participants advance through the levels by performing well in their current division. A week-long summer training camp is held where four students are selected from a group of 24 finalists to represent the United States at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). All expenses are paid for the training camp and competition at IOI. The USACO was founded in 1992 by Don Piele at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and is currently maintained by director Brian Dean at Clemson University and a dedicated volunteer coaching staff.
